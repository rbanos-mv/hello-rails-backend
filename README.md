> This exercise is about creating a "Hello World" application to display a random message. The back-end is built with Rails and the front-end with React.

> ## The front-end for this api service is [Hello react front-end](https://github.com/rbanos-mv/hello-react-frontend)

## Built With

- Ruby on Rails

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

There is a commented `.env.example` file you can use as a guide to configure your own. Type the following commands into the terminal (or Git Bash, if using Windows) to create your `.env` file:

```
cp .env.example .env
